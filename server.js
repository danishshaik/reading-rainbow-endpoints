In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.

Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort, and might even have assisted in the deaths of James and Lily Potter—Harry Potter’s parents. Now Black has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard him muttering in his sleep, \"He’s at Hogwarts... he’s at Hogwarts.\" Of course, Harry already had plenty to worry about. After inflating his nasty aunt and running away on the magical Knight Bus, he finds he’s being pursued by death omens at every turn. He receives two wonderful gifts: a top-of-the-line Firebolt broomstick, and the Marauder’s Map, a magical diagram of Hogwarts made by the mysterious “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.” Hermione disappears frequently, burdened down by a seemingly impossible course schedule. And the soulless Dementors have come to guard Hogwarts—supposedly to protect Harry from Sirius Black, but they terrify Harry more than the fugitive ever could. To strengthen himself against them, Harry reaches out to Remus Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who was once a friend of his father’s. Lupin teaches Harry about the Patronus Charm, a defensive measure well above the level of magic generally mastered by wizards Harry’s age. But even with his broom, his map, his magic, and his loyal friends, Harry isn't safe. Because on top of everything else, there’s a traitor hidden at Hogwarts...","magnet_link":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:3F13D528AE86FEC6CB92DCF20FCA70B8704C6E9E&dn=harry+potter+series+j+k+rowling+books+1+thru+7+epub&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337%2Fannounce","size":"3.89 MB","seeders":"202","sl_ration":28.857142857142858},{"id":"39iYWTb6n6cC","name":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","author":"J.K.

Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts Express, so they fly to school in a blue Ford Anglia, crash landing in the notorious Whomping Willow. Soon other worries accumulate: the outrageously stuck-up new professor Gilderoy Lockhart; a ghost named Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the girls' bathroom; the strange behavior of Ron's little sister, Ginny Weasley; rumors about the \"Chamber of Secrets,\" a cavern buried deep below Hogwarts; and a magical diary owned by Tom Riddle, a Hogwarts student of long ago. Harry is also shocked to discover that he can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes - a rare ability that Lord Voldemort also possessed - and that anti-Muggle prejudice exists in the Wizarding world, even affecting Harry's friend Hermione. But all of these seem like minor concerns when someone starts turning Hogwarts students to stone: an evildoer said to be the fearsome Heir of Salazar Slytherin, on of the founders of the school. Could it be Draco Malfoy, Harry's most poisonous rival? Could it be Hagrid whose mysterious past is finally told?

Satirical and disturbing, Brave New World is set some 600 years ahead, in \"this year of stability, A.F. 632\"--the A.F. standing for After Ford, meaning the godlike Henry Ford. \"Community, Identity, Stability,\" is the motto. Reproduction is controlled through genetic engineering, and people are bred into a rigid class system. As they mature, they are conditioned to be happy with the roles that society has created for them. The rest of their lives are devoted to the pursuit of pleasure through sex, recreational sports, the getting and having of material possessions, and taking a drug called Soma. Concepts such as family, freedom, love, and culture are considered grotesque. Against this backdrop, a young man known as John the Savage is brought to London from the remote desert of New Mexico. What he sees in the new civilization a \"brave new world\" (quoting Shakespeare's The Tempest). However, ultimately, John challenges the basic premise of this society in an act that threatens and fascinates its citizens. Huxley uses his entire prowess to throw the idea of utopia into reverse, presenting us what is known as the \"dystopian\" novel. When Brave New World was written (1931), neither Hitler nor Stalin had risen to power. Huxley saw the enduring threat to society from the dark side of scientific and social progress, and mankind's increasing appetite for simple amusement. Brave New World is a work that indicts the idea of progress for progress sake and is backed up with force and reason.","magnet_link":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1FB5BBB171A7309A06E1D209B6447E55DC1897B9&dn=the+brave+new+world+of+work+epub&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.trackerfix.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","size":"866.9 KB","seeders":"31","sl_ration":6.2},{"id":"MgaBAwAAQBAJ","name":"Crime and Punishment","author":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MgaBAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","description":"Trajectory presents classics of world literature with 21st century features!

Crime and Punishment is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless vermin. He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even have the right to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by comparing himself with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.","magnet_link":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:6E6C6EBBB7B286CC72E12C9C35721F0F5A5CF09B&dn=crime+and+punishment+by+fyodor+mikhailovich+dostoyevsky+republicv&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33domtracker.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","size":"5.47 MB","seeders":"15","sl_ration":15},{"id":"636fngEACAAJ","name":"The Lord of the Rings","author":"J R R Tolkien","pages":1244,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=636fngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","description":"A sumptuous new one-volume edition of Tolkien's classic masterpiece that is fully illustrated in watercolour throughout by the acclaimed and award-winning artist, Alan Lee.

Before writing Dracula, Stoker spent eight years researching European folklore and stories of vampires. Dracula is an epistolary novel, written as collection of diary entries, telegrams, and letters from the characters, as well as fictional clippings from the Whitby and London newspapers. Stoker's inspiration for the story was a visit to Slains Castle near Aberdeen.

In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. Since its publication in 1961, no novel has matched Catch-22’s intensity and brilliance in depicting the brutal insanity of war. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; personal essays on the genesis of the novel by the author; a wealth of critical responses and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and a selection of advertisements from the original publishing campaign that helped turn Catch-22 into a cultural phenomenon. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.","magnet_link":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:CD23501D892AA9F2D6212590BAF42F016472F434&dn=closing+time+by+joseph+heller+a+sequel+to+catch+22&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33domtracker.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","size":"981.17 KB","seeders":"0","sl_ration":null},{"id":"eodb9Sw6hoEC","name":"Ulysses","author":"James Joyce","pages":752,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eodb9Sw6hoEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","description":"Originally reviled as obscure and obscene, Joyce's masterpiece now stands as one of the great literary achievements of the twentieth century. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the novel traces the paths of Leopold Bloom and other Dubliners through an ordinary summer day and night in 1904 — a typical day, transformed by Joyce's narrative powers into an epic celebration of life. First editions of Ulysses rank among the modern rare book trade's most valuable finds. This reprint of the original edition is not only the least expensive version available but also the truest to the author's vision.

Satirical and disturbing, Brave New World is set some 600 years ahead, in \"this year of stability, A.F. 632\"--the A.F. standing for After Ford, meaning the godlike Henry Ford. \"Community, Identity, Stability,\" is the motto. Reproduction is controlled through genetic engineering, and people are bred into a rigid class system. As they mature, they are conditioned to be happy with the roles that society has created for them. The rest of their lives are devoted to the pursuit of pleasure through sex, recreational sports, the getting and having of material possessions, and taking a drug called Soma. Concepts such as family, freedom, love, and culture are considered grotesque. Against this backdrop, a young man known as John the Savage is brought to London from the remote desert of New Mexico. What he sees in the new civilization a \"brave new world\" (quoting Shakespeare's The Tempest). However, ultimately, John challenges the basic premise of this society in an act that threatens and fascinates its citizens. Huxley uses his entire prowess to throw the idea of utopia into reverse, presenting us what is known as the \"dystopian\" novel. When Brave New World was written (1931), neither Hitler nor Stalin had risen to power. Huxley saw the enduring threat to society from the dark side of scientific and social progress, and mankind's increasing appetite for simple amusement. Brave New World is a work that indicts the idea of progress for progress sake and is backed up with force and reason.","magnet_link":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1FB5BBB171A7309A06E1D209B6447E55DC1897B9&dn=the+brave+new+world+of+work+epub&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.trackerfix.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","size":"866.9 KB","seeders":"31","sl_ration":6.2},{"id":"UbfnTcmkaKkC","name":"The Stand","author":"Stephen King","pages":1200,"image_url":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UbfnTcmkaKkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","description":"Stephen King’s apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and tangled in an elemental struggle between good and evil remains as riveting and eerily plausible as when it was first published.
